Mod inspired by my angst that I couldn't put a horseshoe on bundle of balloons.

Currently adds 15 items:

Horseshoe Bundle of Balloons - Combines lucky horseshoe and bundle of balloons
Exotic Bundle of Balloons - Bundle of Balloons, but made with Honey, Tsunami, and Fart balloons
Exotic Horseshot Bundle - Above, but horseshoe
ULTIMATE Bundle of Balloons - All 6 balloons in a single accesssory slot
ULTIMATE Horseshoe Bundle of Balloons - Making the above useable, since 99% of the time you'll just die w/o horseshoe using this thing.
Obsidian Horseshoe variant for all 7 of the balloon accessories and all 3 bundles. (Named "<Color> Balloon Type OH" or "(Exotic/Ultimate) Bundle of Balloons Type OH")

If you have any balloon related ideas to contribute, comment below. I've done everything I set out to do.
If you want to translate to any languages feel free to send me the .hjson and I'll add it in.
